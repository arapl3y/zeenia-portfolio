      "descriptionText": "<br>\n\n**The Challenge**\n\n<br>\n\nAround 70% of people are paying more than they need for their energy. This happens for a number of reasons including a lack of engagement with utilities, high levels of friction involved in the switching process, and general distrust in energy providers and comparison sites.\n\nAs a result, many people unknowingly stay with overpriced legacy plans, when they could be saving by switching to a newer plan.",
