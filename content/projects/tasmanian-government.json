  "intro": "<br>\n\nWith the team at Mentally Friendly, we worked on this super interesting research project for Service Tasmania. \n\nIt was an interesting challenge of synthesising data from over 100 user interviews and workshops (across 4 different regions of Tasmania) into a cohesive report that explored what Tasmanian citizens need vs want from digital government services.",

      "descriptionText": "This was a user-research heavy project which required a lot of complex data analysis, synthesis, and visualisation. We resulted in five unique user segments for the Tasmanian state. \n\nIt was a compelling design challenge to create a report that was simple to read & follow, yet allowed for full insight comprehension that created action bias. The last thing we wanted was for the data to be overlooked and no actions to be derived.",
