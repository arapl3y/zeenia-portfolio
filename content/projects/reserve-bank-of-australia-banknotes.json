  "intro": "<br>\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is Australia’s central bank and banknote issuing authority. It is the RBA’s responsibility to maintain the stability of nation’s currency and ensure the economic prosperity of the Australian population.\n\nWith the release of the Next Generation of Banknotes (NGB) in Australia, the RBA needed to update it’s public Banknotes iOS and Android app to accommodate for the new $5 and $10 notes (and subsequent releases for the remaining banknotes). \n\nThe overall aim of the app is to enable users to learn about banknote design and security features, and how to handle counterfeit and damaged banknotes.",

      "descriptionText": "I was given the opportunity to work closely with the IBM Interactive Experience (IX) team (based in St Leonards) for the duration of the project to assist with the UI and UX design for both native apps.\n\nAccessibility was one of the key specifications for the project as the app had to consider the requirements of the entire Australian population. Designing a mobile app whilst remaining Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliant was an interesting task, a constraint that I have never worked with in the past."
